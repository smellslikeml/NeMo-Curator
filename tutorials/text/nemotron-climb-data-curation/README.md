# Nemotron-CLIMB Data Curation

[CLustering-based Iterative Data Mixture Bootstrapping (Nemotron-CLIMB)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13161) is an automated framework that discovers, evaluates, and refines data mixtures in a pretraining setting. Specifically, Nemotron-CLIMB embeds and clusters large-scale datasets in a semantic space and then iteratively searches for optimal mixtures using a smaller proxy model and a predictor.

This tutorial uses NeMo Curator to implement the data curation recipe used to create the [Nemotron-CLIMB dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/Nemotron-ClimbMix). At a high level, it follows these steps:

1. Compute text embeddings per document.
2. Cluster the documents with K-Means.
3. Use FastText classification models to remove low-quality clusters, then merge similar clusters according to a Euclidean distance threshold.
4. Tokenize and write to `.bin` and `.idx` files.
5. Use a Dirichlet distribution to generate data mixtures.
6. Train a proxy model for each data mixture using Megatron-LM.
7. Benchmark each proxy model using LM Evaluation Harness.
8. Fit a LightGBM predictor on the benchmark results and use the predictor to generate an optimal data mixture for full-scale LLM training.

For reference, the [Nemotron-CLIMB dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/Nemotron-ClimbMix) was produced using this pipeline on multi-terabyte pretraining corpora. See the [Nemotron-CLIMB paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13161) for full experimental details, ablations, and results.

## Step 0: Requirements

The following Python libraries are needed to run this tutorial:

- `nemo-curator`
- `xformers`
- `megatron-core`
- `lm-eval`
- `lightgbm`

NeMo Curator should be installed with the `text_cuda12` extra. See the installation options on the [Text Quickstart](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/curator/get-started/text) for more information. Installation commands for the other libraries above are included within their respective sections.

As an example, Curator can be installed from source and additional dependencies can be installed with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Curator.git
cd Curator
uv sync --extra text_cuda12 --all-groups
source .venv/bin/activate
cd ..
uv pip install xformers
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness
cd lm-evaluation-harness
uv pip install -e .
cd ..
uv pip install lightgbm
```

The above installation commands were used for testing this tutorial and include all dependencies needed for running steps 1-5 and 7-8 of the tutorial.

To run NeMo Curator, the following system requirements are needed:

- Ubuntu 22.04/20.04
- NVIDIA GPU with:
  - Volta™ or higher (compute capability 7.0+)
  - CUDA 12.x

For step 6 (proxy model training with Megatron-LM), refer to the [Megatron Core Installation documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/megatron-core/developer-guide/latest/get-started/install.html) for information about the system requirements for running Megatron-LM; the [NeMo Framework container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/nemo) was used for testing this step.

If any of the individual input JSONL or Parquet files are greater than 2 GB, it is recommended to use the `nemo_curator/utils/split_large_files.py` helper script to split them into more manageable sizes and prevent out-of-memory issues. For example:

```bash
python /path/to/Curator/nemo_curator/utils/split_large_files.py \
    --input-path "/path/to/data_dir" \
    --file-type "jsonl" \
    --output-path "/path/to/sharded_dir" \
    --target-size-mb 128
```

shards every file in the input path and outputs files that are 128 MB each.

## Step 1: Compute Embeddings

Compute text embeddings on the dataset with:

```bash
# run `uv pip install xformers` to use NovaSearch/stella_en_400M_v5 model

python 1_embed.py \
    --input-path /path/to/input/data/dir \
    --input-filetype "jsonl" \
    --output-path /path/to/computed_embeddings \
    --text-field "text" \
    --id-field "_curator_climb_id" \
    --use-sentence-transformer
```

At least 1 GPU is required to run this step. Use the `--num-cpus` and `--num-gpus` arguments as desired to control the number of CPUs and GPUs used by the Ray client. The script uses all available resources by default.

To match the [Nemotron-CLIMB paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13161), the script uses the [NovaSearch/stella_en_400M_v5](https://huggingface.co/NovaSearch/stella_en_400M_v5) embedding model by default:

- The [xFormers](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) library is required to run the [NovaSearch/stella_en_400M_v5](https://huggingface.co/NovaSearch/stella_en_400M_v5) model and should be installed via `uv pip install xformers` before running the script.
- The [SentenceTransformers](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers) library is used via the `use-sentence-transformer` flag to enhance performance. It is already included as a dependency in Curator and does not need to be manually installed.

Some of the default parameters in the script include:

- Use `--model_inference_batch_size 1024` to create digestible batch sizes for the model forward pass. Adjust as necessary; decrease the size to address memory issues and increase the size to improve performance.
- Use [NovaSearch/stella_en_400M_v5](https://huggingface.co/NovaSearch/stella_en_400M_v5)'s `max_length` of 512 via the `--max-seq-length` argument.
- Use `--transformers-init-kwargs '{"trust_remote_code": true}'` as required to load the [NovaSearch/stella_en_400M_v5](https://huggingface.co/NovaSearch/stella_en_400M_v5) model.

See script for full list of parameters.

## Step 2: K-Means Clustering

Run K-Means clustering on the computed embeddings:

```bash
python 2_cluster.py \
    --input-path /path/to/computed_embeddings \
    --output-path /path/to/clusters \
    --text-field "text" \
    --id-field "_curator_climb_id" \
    --embedding-dim 3072 \
    --centroids-path /path/to/centroids
```

At least 1 GPU is required to run this step. Use the `--num-cpus` and `--num-gpus` arguments as desired to control the number of CPUs and GPUs used by the Ray client. The script uses all available resources by default.

The script uses `--n-clusters 1000` as the default. Set the `--embedding-dim` to 2-3x the embedding model's dimension to avoid GPU out-of-memory issues (the default dimension for [NovaSearch/stella_en_400M_v5](https://huggingface.co/NovaSearch/stella_en_400M_v5) is 1024, so set `--embedding-dim 3072`).

The `--id-field` generated from step 1 is required. See script for full list of K-Means parameters.

## Step 3: Cluster Pruning

Use a FastText model to prune the created clusters:

```bash
FASTTEXT_MODEL_PATHS=(
    /path/to/best_model_advertisement.bin
    /path/to/best_model_cultural_value.bin
    /path/to/best_model_educational_value.bin
    /path/to/best_model_informational_value.bin
    /path/to/best_model_quality.bin
)
FASTTEXT_SCORE_FIELDS=(
    advertisement_score
    cultural_value_score
    educational_value_score
    informational_value_score
    quality_score
)
FASTTEXT_PRUNING_THRESHOLDS=(2.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0)
python 3_prune.py \
    --input-path /path/to/clusters \
    --output-path /path/to/pruned_clusters \
    --fasttext-model-paths ${FASTTEXT_MODEL_PATHS[@]} \
    --score-fields ${FASTTEXT_SCORE_FIELDS[@]} \
    --text-field "text" \
    --pruning-thresholds ${FASTTEXT_PRUNING_THRESHOLDS[@]} \
    --centroids-path /path/to/centroids \
    --merge-threshold 1.5
```

No GPUs are needed to run this step. Use the `--num-cpus` argument as desired to control the number of CPUs used by the Ray client; by default, all are used. However, because each FastText model is large, CPU out-of-memory errors may occur due to overhead between stage workers. Try decreasing the number of CPUs if needed.

There are 5 FastText quality models that can be used for this step. Each is availble on Hugging Face under [nvidia/nemotron-climb-fasttext-classifiers](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/nemotron-climb-fasttext-classifiers):

- [best_model_advertisement.bin](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/nemotron-climb-fasttext-classifiers/blob/main/best_model_advertisement.bin)
- [best_model_cultural_value.bin](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/nemotron-climb-fasttext-classifiers/blob/main/best_model_cultural_value.bin)
- [best_model_educational_value.bin](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/nemotron-climb-fasttext-classifiers/blob/main/best_model_educational_value.bin)
- [best_model_informational_value.bin](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/nemotron-climb-fasttext-classifiers/blob/main/best_model_informational_value.bin)
- [best_model_quality.bin](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/nemotron-climb-fasttext-classifiers/blob/main/best_model_quality.bin)

Download each file with the following pattern:

```python
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download

path = hf_hub_download(
    repo_id="nvidia/nemotron-climb-fasttext-classifiers",
    filename="best_model_advertisement.bin",
)

print(path)
```

Users may opt to run the script with all 5 models as demonstrated above, or a subset of the models. For each path in `--fasttext-model-paths`, a unique score field must be set via the `--score-fields` argument. After the FastText scores are computed, clusters with an average score less than the corresponding pruning threshold are removed. For example, in the above snippet, the average advertisement score of a cluster must be 2.0 or larger; the rest of the cultural, educational, informational, and quality scores must be 1.0 or larger.

Finally, remaining clusters with a Euclidean distance closer than `--merge-threshold 1.5` are combined with each other to form super clusters.

## Step 4: Convert to Tokenized Files

Generate `.bin` and `.idx` files for each cluster:

```bash
python 4_tokenize.py \
    --input-path /path/to/pruned_clusters \
    --output-path /path/to/domains \
    --hf-token "hf_XXX" \
    --text-field "text" \
    --append-eod
```

where `--input-path /path/to/pruned_clusters` is the directory created by step 3 and contains `centroid=*` subdirectories.

By default, the script tokenizes the text using [https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b), which is a gated model. The user can request access to it on Hugging Face and pass the `--hf-token` argument as demonstrated above.

The pipeline generates pairs of files with identical names: one with a `.bin` extension and another with a `.idx` extension. This ensures that the input data files are compatible with Megatron-LM, which is used in step 6 to train the proxy models. Megatron-LM refers to the filename without the file extension as the "file prefix."

## Step 5: Generate Training Data Mixtures

Generate a mixture of data ratios to be used for training the proxy models:

```bash
python 5_mixture.py \
    --input-path /path/to/domains \
    --output-path /path/to/mixtures \
    --num-mixtures 64
```

Using the `.bin` files generated by the previous step, the script calculates the token distribution across the files. It initializes a Dirichlet distribution based on each cluster's token count and sample configurations. The value of `--num-mixtures` mixtures are generated.

## Step 6: Train Proxy Models

Kick off a Megatron training job with a specified data mixture:

```bash
bash 6_train.sh \
    /path/to/Megatron-LM/pretrain_gpt.py \
    /path/to/mixtures/n1.sh \
    /path/to/megatron_exp/n1 \
    /path/to/Llama-2-7b/tokenizer.model \
    /path/to/pretrained_model  # optional
```

The above script requires Megatron-LM to be installed. System requirements and installation instructions can be found on the [Megatron Core Installation documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/megatron-core/developer-guide/latest/get-started/install.html) page. If using Docker, make sure to obtain an NGC API key from the [NVIDIA NGC Catalog](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/). Clone the Megatron-LM repository so that the [pretrain_gpt.py](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/blob/main/pretrain_gpt.py) can be obtained directly.

For reference, the tutorial was developed and tested by following these steps:

- `docker run --runtime nvidia --gpus all --ipc=host --shm-size=16g -it --rm -v /path/to/data:/path/to/data -v /path/to/Curator:/path/to/Curator nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:26.02.nemotron_3_super`
- The Python script `/opt/Megatron-Bridge/3rdparty/Megatron-LM/pretrain_gpt.py` is already included inside the container and can be used as is.
- `bash /path/to/Curator/tutorials/text/nemotron-climb-data-curation/6_train.sh ...`

A proxy model can be trained for each of the data ratios generated by step 5. The above snippet trains a single proxy model using the first mixture. The script takes 4 required inputs and 1 optional input, in order:

- `PRETRAIN_GPT_PATH` (`/path/to/Megatron-LM/pretrain_gpt.py`): The path to Megatron-LM's [pretrain_gpt.py](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/blob/main/pretrain_gpt.py) script.
- `MIXTURE_SCRIPT` (`/path/to/mixtures/n1.sh`): The path to any of the mixture files generated by step 5.
- `WORK_PATH` (`/path/to/megatron_exp/n1`): The path to be used for checkpoints, caching, etc. The work path should be unique per training job.
- `TOKENIZER_MODEL` (`/path/to/Llama-2-7b/tokenizer.model`): The path to the tokenizer used in step 4.
- `PRETRAINED_MODEL_PATH` (`/path/to/pretrained_model`, optional): Path to an existing Megatron checkpoint directory to fine-tune from. When set, the script passes `--load $PRETRAINED_MODEL_PATH --finetune` to `pretrain_gpt.py`. When omitted, training starts from scratch and `--load` points at `WORK_PATH/checkpoint` so restarts naturally resume from the in-progress run. Use this to fine-tune from a base model released by NVIDIA or another open-source checkpoint instead of training from random init.

NVIDIA has released two Megatron checkpoints that can each be used as a base model for proxy training via `PRETRAINED_MODEL_PATH`. Both are available under [nvidia/nemotron-climb-proxy-models](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/nemotron-climb-proxy-models). Each is a decoder-only transformer pretrained on 10T tokens with a WSD (Warmup-Stable-Decay) learning rate schedule and tensor parallelism of 1:

- `nemotron_climb_proxy_model_62m`: 62M parameters, 32 layers, trained for 2,500,000 iterations across 8 nodes.
- `nemotron_climb_proxy_model_350m`: 350M parameters, 32 layers, trained for 2,384,053 iterations across 16 nodes.

Download either folder (containing `iter_*/` and `latest_checkpointed_iteration.txt`) and pass its path as `PRETRAINED_MODEL_PATH`.

**Note: If using a pretrained model, make sure parameters like `--num-layers`, `--hidden-size`, `--num-attention-heads`, `--max-position-embeddings`, `--tokenizer-type`, `--tokenizer-model`, etc. in `6_train.sh` match the loaded checkpoint.**

If needed, download the tokenizer file with:

```python
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download

path = hf_hub_download(
    repo_id="meta-llama/Llama-2-7b",
    filename="tokenizer.model",
    token="hf_XXX",
)

print(path)
```

Since the goal is to train proxy models to compare against each other, the script triggers a timeout after roughly 2 hours via `--exit-duration-in-mins 110`. If 64 proxy models are trained, this amounts to roughly 120 hours spent training. Set a shorter runtime depending on available hardware and compute budgets.

See `6_train.sh` script for full list of parameters used during training and modify as desired. Tips and considerations are included in the comments of the script. Refer to the [Megatron Core documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/megatron-core/developer-guide/latest/user-guide/training-examples.html) for more information.

By default, all available GPUs are used for training. The script was developed and tested on a single node; modifications are needed to adapt it for multi-node runs.

## Step 7: Evaluate Proxy Models

Evaluate the proxy models using [LM Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/tree/main):

```bash
bash 7_evaluate.sh \
    /path/to/lm-evaluation-harness \
    /path/to/Megatron-LM \
    /path/to/megatron_exp \
    /path/to/lm_eval_results \
    /path/to/Llama-2-7b/tokenizer.model
```

LM Evaluation Harness can be installed with:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness
cd lm-evaluation-harness
uv pip install -e .
```

The script requires Megatron to be installed. Here is an example for how to set up and run the evaluation step:

- `docker run --runtime nvidia --gpus all --ipc=host --shm-size=16g -it --rm -v /path/to/data:/path/to/data -v /path/to/Curator:/path/to/Curator nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:26.02.nemotron_3_super`
- Install `lm-eval` as instructed above.
- `bash /path/to/Curator/tutorials/text/nemotron-climb-data-curation/7_evaluate.sh ...`

The above script looks for 5 inputs in order:

- `LM_EVAL_PATH` (`/path/to/lm-evaluation-harness`): The path to the LM Evaluation Harness directory.
- `MEGATRON_PATH` (`/path/to/Megatron-LM`): The path to the Megatron-LM directory.
- `BASE_CKPT_DIR` (`/path/to/megatron_exp`): The path to the trained proxy models from step 6, with subdirectories `/path/to/megatron_exp/n1`, `/path/to/megatron_exp/n2`, etc. per model.
- `RESULTS_DIR` (`/path/to/lm_eval_results`): The path to save the benchmarking results.
- `TOKENIZER_MODEL` (`/path/to/Llama-2-7b/tokenizer.model`): The path to the tokenizer used in steps 4 and 6.

The script evaluates each proxy model on the [ARC-Easy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05457), [HellaSwag](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07830), and [PIQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11641) benchmarks.

By default, all available GPUs are used for benchmarking. Make sure the `model_args` used in `7_evaluate.sh` match those used in `6_train.sh` (e.g., `tokenizer_type=Llama2Tokenizer` and `seq_length=1024`).

## Step 8: Fit Predictor

Fit a [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) predictor on the results with:

```bash
# run `uv pip install lightgbm` if not already installed

python 8_predict.py \
    --input-paths /path/to/lm_eval_results \
    --domains-path /path/to/domains \
    --mixtures-paths /path/to/mixtures \
    --output-path /path/to/predict_results \
    --metric "valid_avg" \
    --num-mixtures 1
```

The script uses `lightgbm` which can be installed via `uv pip install lightgbm`. It requires several inputs:

- `--input-paths`: One or more `lm_eval_results` directories from step 7 (space-separated), paired by position with `--mixtures-paths`.
- `--domains-path`: The output `domains` directory from step 4 containing the `.bin` and `.idx` files.
- `--mixtures-paths`: One or more `mixtures` directories from steps 5 and/or 8 (space-separated), paired by position with `--input-paths`.
- `--output-path`: Path to write the output mixture(s).

The script fits a LightGBM predictor by using the data mixtures as the features and the average benchmark score (via `--metric "valid_avg"`) as the target. It then outputs `--num-mixtures 1` data ratios which represent the optimal data mixture(s) to use for LLM training.

From here, the user may opt to use `num_mixtures > 1` and repeat steps 6 and 7 with the newly generated data mixtures. Then, the new benchmarks can be combined with the existing benchmarks to rerun step 8 and fit a predictor with all benchmarking data. The goal is to iterate upon steps 6, 7, and 8 until a single optimal data mixture is produced to be used for full-scale LLM training.

To fit the LightGBM predictor on multiple rounds of proxy model evaluations at once, pass space-separated lists to `--input-paths` and `--mixtures-paths`. Each `--input-paths` entry is paired with the `--mixtures-paths` entry at the same position, and all rows are combined into a single table for fitting:

```bash
python 8_predict.py \
    --input-paths /path/to/lm_eval_results /path/to/lm_eval_results_2 \
    --domains-path /path/to/domains \
    --mixtures-paths /path/to/mixtures /path/to/mixtures_2 \
    --output-path /path/to/mixtures_3 \
    --metric "valid_avg" \
    --num-mixtures 16
```

## End-to-End Script

The `e2e.sh` script contains a full end-to-end example for how to run the Nemotron-CLIMB curation loop. It assumes all installation requirements as listed in previous sections are met.

The proxy model training jobs are executed serially in the end-to-end script. It is recommended to use a workload manager like Slurm to run proxy model training jobs in parallel.

## Conclusion

To follow the [Nemotron-CLIMB paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13161) exactly:

- Run steps 1-7, generating 64 data mixtures in step 5 and training a single proxy model per data mixture (64 models total).
- Run step 8 to fit a predictor on the benchmarks from the 64 models. Generate 32 more mixtures.
- Re-run steps 6 and 7 with the 32 data mixtures.
- Re-run step 8 to fit a predictor using current and past benchmarks (64 + 32 = 96 total). Generate 16 more mixtures.
- Re-run steps 6 and 7 with the 16 data mixtures.
- Re-run step 8 to fit a predictor using current and past benchmarks (96 + 16 = 112 total). Generate 1 more mixture.
- Use the final data mixture for full-scale LLM training.

By iteratively refining the data mixture across three rounds (64 -> 32 -> 16 -> 1), the predictor is trained on an increasingly rich set of mixture-performance pairs, resulting in a more accurate estimate of the optimal data mixture. The final mixture can then be used to train a full-scale LLM with a data composition that is empirically grounded in downstream benchmark performance.

## Optional: Embedding Refinement with EmbedFilter

Adapted from [Your UnEmbedding Matrix is Secretly a Feature Lens for Text Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.07502) (EmbedFilter).

LLM-derived text embeddings tend to over-express a few directions that correlate with frequent-but-uninformative tokens, which can blur the semantic structure that K-Means relies on in step 2. EmbedFilter removes that dominant subspace with a single fixed linear transformation, sharpening the embeddings and -- as a byproduct -- reducing their dimensionality (smaller centroids, faster clustering and retrieval).

`1_embed.py` accepts an optional `--embedding-filter-path` pointing at a serialized filter. When provided, an `EmbeddingRefinerStage` is inserted after the embedding stage and before the writer, refining the embedding column in place so no downstream step changes.

Fit a filter once on a representative sample of embeddings (for example, the output of an initial `1_embed.py` run) and save it:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from nemo_curator.stages.text.embedders.embedding_refiner import EmbeddingSubspaceFilter

# Load a sample of already-computed embeddings, e.g. from /path/to/computed_embeddings
sample = pd.read_parquet("/path/to/computed_embeddings")
embeddings = np.asarray(sample["embeddings"].tolist(), dtype=np.float32)

# Drop the top frequency-aligned direction and keep 512 refined dimensions.
emb_filter = EmbeddingSubspaceFilter.fit(embeddings, num_components_to_remove=1, output_dim=512)
emb_filter.save("/path/to/embedding_filter.npz")
```

Then re-run step 1 with the filter applied:

```bash
python 1_embed.py \
    --input-path /path/to/input/data/dir \
    --input-filetype "jsonl" \
    --output-path /path/to/refined_embeddings \
    --text-field "text" \
    --id-field "_curator_climb_id" \
    --use-sentence-transformer \
    --embedding-filter-path /path/to/embedding_filter.npz
```

Because the filter is fixed, it is applied identically to every shard, so the refined embedding space stays consistent across the dataset. Set `--embedding-dim` in step 2 to match the refined dimension (for the example above, 2-3x of 512).
